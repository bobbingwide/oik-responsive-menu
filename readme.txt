== Description ==
A jQuery responsive select menu. When the window size reduces to a minimum width (default 640 px)
then the selected navigation menu is converted to a simple select menu.
This makes the menu great for iPhones and other mobile phones where display space is a premium.
The clever work is done in the jQuery. 

Works for: 
* standard WordPress themes such as Twenty Twelve, Twenty Eleven and Twenty Ten
* Artisteer generated themes using the default CSS prefix with menus in .art-outer-nav
* Themes using the <nav> tag to wrap their main menu
* Any other theme which contains a menu using <ul> within an identfifiable selector
